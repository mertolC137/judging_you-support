# Judging You — Account & Data Deletion

This page explains how to request deletion of your Judging You account and associated data.

## Option 1 — Delete your account (recommended)
If you signed in with Google (cloud sync), you can request full deletion of:

- Your Firebase Authentication account
- All synced app data stored under your user ID (e.g., categories, day types, entries)

### How to request deletion
Send an email to: **judgingyoutheapp@gmail.com**
Subject: **Judging You — Delete my account**

Please include:
- The email address you used to sign in with Google

### Processing time
Deletion is typically completed within **30 days**.

### What is deleted
- Account identifiers used for authentication
- Synced tracking data (categories, entries, settings)

### What may be retained
- Aggregated, non-identifying metrics (only if collected)

## Option 2 — Guest mode (anonymous / local-only)
If you only used the app in guest mode without enabling cloud sync, your data is stored locally on your device.
To delete local data:
- Uninstall the app, or
- Use any in-app “reset/delete local data” option (if available)

## Option 3 — Category deletion (anonymous / google log in)
If you delete any category from the category page, all the saved data of that category will be removed from your local cache.
Syncing afterwards will also delete the saved data from the database. Doing it for all categories will remove all habit scores.
- deleting a category from categories page
- syncing through settings page
